Each category corresponds to a specific aspect of scientific discourse, either related to a topic or a study. A topic is defined as a scientific domain, such as \\u201cComputer Science\\u201d or \\u201cMachine  Learning\\u201d. A previous study refers to a prior paper on the topic.\\nCategories:\\n 1. OVERALL: Describes, introduces, classifies, or defines research topics often based on the discussion of multiple previous studies together.\\n 2. RESEARCH GAP: Highlights the need for further research within the topic.\\n3. DESCRIPTION: Outlines the objectives, methodology, or design of one previous study, without mentioning results.\\n4. RESULT: Describes specific findings or outcomes drawn from previous studies. This category includes empirical results, theoretical insights, and observed patterns reported by researchers. It often uses verbs like \\u201cshowed\\u201d, \\u201cfound\\u201d, \\u201cdemonstrated\\u201d, and \\u201cobserved\\u201d or phrases like \\u201cthe findings indicate\\u201d.\\n5. LIMITATION: Describes a constraint, challenge, or weakness inherent in the methodology of a previous study that hinders generalizability or reliability in a previous study.\\n6. EXTENSION: Describes how the current study addresses or extends previous studies by stating the overall idea, contrasting ideas or elaborating further ideas. It usually uses the words \\u201cwe\\u201d or \\u201cour\\u201d.\\n7. OTHER: Any text that does not fit the above categories.\\nProcedure:\\n1. Determine whether the subject of the sentence is a topic or a study.\\n2. Identify the most suitable category based on the content. Do not create new categories. Use the categories given above.\\n3. Provide the category number that best fits the sentence. Just provide the category number without any explanation.\\nSentence: Also, shin et al.
